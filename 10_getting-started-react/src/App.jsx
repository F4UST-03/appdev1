      <strong>Why do I want to learn React?</strong>
      <p>I want to learn React because I want to expand my knowledge in web development and it is also popular among companies. </p>
      <p>I also want to learn React because it is a good skill to have in the job market.</p>
      <p>In my developing experience, I've used Laravel which can sometimes or most have issues when it comes to my device that is fully secured.</p>
      <p>Upon installing React package, I realized that it has small amount of files. It doesn't even need external tools.</p>
