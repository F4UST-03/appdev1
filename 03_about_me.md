## Why I Want to Learn Git & GitHub

Aside from GitHub being a great environment for developers, I want to know and learn GitHub because I often encounter them whenever I research for information about codes and bugs, for frontend user interfaces. The first time I tried using GitHub, I find it more complicated than expected. I don't know what to do with these repositories provided by the authors/sources. I got even more curious as to why is there Git aside from GitHub. The moment I/we explore about GIt and GitHub, I realized that learning these will make my life as a developer a whole lot easier.
